## Overview

This is a Python application designed to take input from user and display a counter, counter will be incremented with every second until it is stoped by user or the value of counter matches the user input. This README provides instructions on how to set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies using `requirements.txt`.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Python 3.x. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up your environment and install the required packages:

1. Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luqmansarwar012/python_task_one.git
   cd python_task_one
   ```

2. Create a Virtual Environment It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create one using venv:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS and Linux:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the Required Packages With the virtual environment activated, install the packages listed in requirements.txt:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application using:

```bash
python main.py
```
